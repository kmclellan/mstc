# MSTC App

**Multiple Sclerosis Therapy Centre Client, Resource and Therapy Session Management**

An open source, Ruby on Rails project to provide Multiple Sclerosis Therapy Centres an integrated tool to manage clients, resources and oxygen therapy sessions.  Please see [Use Cases](https://github.com/kmclellan/mstc/wiki/Use-Cases) in the wiki for a view of where this project will be going and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kmclellan/mstc/issues/) for the user stories that have been prioritised for development.

Initially created for the MS Therapy Centre Lothian http://www.mstc-lothian.org.uk/

The software is intended to be run onsite on a dedicated Linux based server but can also be run in the "cloud" (for a demo, please [see the latest version running on Heroku](https://mstc.herokuapp.com/)).

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Pull requests and bug reports are always welcome!

## Initial Developmet

Text files have been created (found under ./doc/) giving a very basic listing of features that are required or desired.  These documents should provide a general idea of the controlers and data fields which need to be created.

## Installation for Development

### Requirements

Before you get started, the following needs to be installed:

  * **Ruby** (Linux) 2.5.1
  * **Ruby** (Windows) 2.2.5  -  Will probably need the [DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
  * [**RubyGems**](http://rubygems.org/)
  * **Bundler**: `gem install bundler`
  * [**Git**](http://help.github.com/git-installation-redirect)

Grab the code:

```
git clone git://github.com/kmclellan/mstc.git
```

Install the dependancies:

```
cd mstc
bundle install
```

Initiate your development database:

```
bundle exec rails db:create
bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

(Currently do not have a schema to load.)

To view the application run a Rack webserver.  In production this will be Phusion Passenger (simple and reliable deployment).  For development I am currently using Puma.

```
bundle exec puma
```

http://localhost:3000
